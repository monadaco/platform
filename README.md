# Monada&Co Platform Blocks

This repository includes the set of platform building blocks for Monada&Co.

Our building blocks are available as native Kubernetes custom resources. All you need to do in order to use one of them is to simply add them to your Helm `templates/` directory
and ArgoCD will pick them up and make you happy.

Check out the [#monadaco-platform](https://wingcloud.slack.com/archives/C07FE4BNTMK) Slack channel for notifications about resource lifecycle and help with diagnostics.

We use [kblocks](https://kblocks.io) to create these building blocks.
